Introduction
Procedural programming is a structured programming approach where the program is composed of procedures or functions that are executed sequentially. It emphasizes step-by-step instructions and can be an effective approach for solving specific problems or implementing smaller-scale applications.

This repository serves as a guide to help you understand the fundamental concepts and techniques of procedural programming in Python. It covers topics such as function definition and invocation, variable scoping, control structures, and code organization.

Getting Started
To get started with procedural programming in Python, follow these steps:

Clone this repository to your local machine.
Ensure you have Python installed (version 3.0 or above).
Explore the code examples and accompanying explanations in the repository.
Key Features of Procedural Programming
Procedural programming in Python offers several key features, including:

Modularity: Breaking down the code into functions or procedures that can be reused and tested independently.
Sequential Execution: Code is executed step by step in a sequential manner, following the order of instructions.
Variable Scoping: Understanding variable scope within functions and their accessibility within different parts of the program.
Control Structures: Utilizing control structures such as conditionals (if-else) and loops (for, while) to control program flow.
Code Organization: Structuring the code by dividing it into logical sections and functions for better readability and maintainability.
Examples
This repository provides various examples to demonstrate procedural programming concepts in Python. Each example is accompanied by clear explanations to enhance your understanding. You can explore the examples by navigating through the code files.

Here are some of the examples available:

Function definition and invocation.
Variable scoping and understanding local and global variables.
Conditional statements (if-else) and loops (for, while).
Code organization techniques.
Feel free to modify and experiment with the examples to deepen your understanding of procedural programming.
